### **15. Custom Resources in Terraform**

In **Terraform**, the ecosystem of available providers and resources is extensive, but there are cases where a specific resource or functionality is not supported by an existing provider. In such cases, you can create **custom resources** to manage infrastructure that is not directly supported. This can be achieved by writing a **custom provider** using the **Terraform Provider SDK**.

Creating a custom resource typically involves two key components:
1. **Writing a Custom Provider**: This involves using the Terraform Provider SDK to define how to interact with the custom resource.
2. **Defining Custom Resources**: Once the provider is written, you define custom resources that will be managed by Terraform.

### **15.1. What Are Custom Resources?**

A **custom resource** in Terraform is a resource that is not available in any of the publicly supported Terraform providers. If you need to manage infrastructure that Terraform doesn't natively support, you can write your own provider to expose and manage these resources.

For example:
- Integrating with a legacy system that doesn't have a public API supported by Terraform.
- Managing resources in a private cloud or an on-premises system.
- Automating tasks that Terraform providers don't currently support.

---

### **15.2. When to Create a Custom Resource**

You may need to create a custom resource when:
- **Terraform does not support your resource**: For example, if you need to manage a custom or niche service or hardware that isn’t covered by any existing Terraform provider.
- **Interacting with proprietary APIs**: When you want to manage resources in an environment or system that has a custom API but doesn't have an existing Terraform provider.
- **Extending Terraform’s capabilities**: If you want to manage resources that are specific to your company or use case.

### **15.3. Creating a Custom Terraform Provider**

Creating a custom provider in Terraform involves several steps, including writing the provider using Go, compiling it, and using it within your Terraform configuration.

Here are the high-level steps to create a custom provider:

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Install **Go** (the language used to write Terraform providers).
   - Set up your development environment to work with the **Terraform Provider SDK**.

2. **Write the Provider**:
   - Use the **Terraform Provider SDK** to define the resources and data sources your provider will manage.
   - Implement the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for each resource.
   - Define the schema for the resources, which includes specifying the attributes, validation, and how the resource interacts with the API.

3. **Compile the Provider**:
   - After writing the code for your provider, compile it into a binary that Terraform can use.

4. **Install and Use the Custom Provider**:
   - Once your provider is built, install it locally and configure it in your Terraform configuration.
   - Use your custom resources just like any other resource in Terraform.

### **15.4. Example: Creating a Custom Provider**

Let's walk through a basic example where we create a simple custom provider that interacts with a hypothetical API to manage **CustomResource**.

#### **Step 1: Create a Go Module for Your Provider**

Start by creating a Go module for your provider. Run the following commands to initialize your Go project:

```bash
mkdir terraform-provider-customresource
cd terraform-provider-customresource
go mod init terraform-provider-customresource
```

#### **Step 2: Define the Provider**

Create a Go file (`provider.go`) where we will define the custom provider and its schema.

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/helper/schema"
)

func main() {
  // Define the provider
  provider := &schema.Provider{
    ResourcesMap: map[string]*schema.Resource{
      "customresource_example": resourceCustomResourceExample(),
    },
  }

  // Start the provider
  if err := provider.InternalValidate(); err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
}

func resourceCustomResourceExample() *schema.Resource {
  return &schema.Resource{
    Create: resourceCustomResourceExampleCreate,
    Read:   resourceCustomResourceExampleRead,
    Update: resourceCustomResourceExampleUpdate,
    Delete: resourceCustomResourceExampleDelete,
    Schema: map[string]*schema.Schema{
      "name": &schema.Schema{
        Type:     schema.TypeString,
        Required: true,
      },
      "description": &schema.Schema{
        Type:     schema.TypeString,
        Optional: true,
      },
    },
  }
}

func resourceCustomResourceExampleCreate(d *schema.ResourceData, m interface{}) error {
  name := d.Get("name").(string)
  description := d.Get("description").(string)
  // Make API call to create the resource here
  d.SetId(name) // Set resource ID
  return nil
}

func resourceCustomResourceExampleRead(d *schema.ResourceData, m interface{}) error {
  // Fetch resource data from the API and update the schema
  return nil
}

func resourceCustomResourceExampleUpdate(d *schema.ResourceData, m interface{}) error {
  // Update resource data via API
  return nil
}

func resourceCustomResourceExampleDelete(d *schema.ResourceData, m interface{}) error {
  // Delete the resource via API
  return nil
}
```

- The `resourceCustomResourceExample` function defines the CRUD operations for our custom resource. In this case, it handles a resource called `customresource_example`.
- The `name` and `description` are resource attributes that can be configured.
- You would implement the actual API interactions (e.g., sending HTTP requests) in the CRUD functions.

#### **Step 3: Build the Custom Provider**

After implementing the provider, you will need to compile it. You can use Go to build the provider into an executable file:

```bash
go build -o terraform-provider-customresource
```

This will produce a binary `terraform-provider-customresource` that Terraform can use.

#### **Step 4: Using the Custom Provider in Terraform Configuration**

Once the provider is compiled, you can use it in your Terraform configuration.

1. Place the compiled binary in the appropriate plugin directory (`~/.terraform.d/plugins` for local use).
2. Write the Terraform configuration to use your custom provider.

```hcl
provider "customresource" {
  # Provider configuration (if needed)
}

resource "customresource_example" "example" {
  name        = "example_resource"
  description = "This is a custom resource."
}
```

Run `terraform init` to initialize the configuration and then use `terraform apply` to create the resource.

### **15.5. Terraform Provider SDK**

To create a custom provider, you will use the **Terraform Provider SDK**. The SDK provides utilities and structures that make it easier to interact with Terraform's internal mechanisms and API. The SDK helps in:

- Defining resource schemas and handling CRUD operations.
- Managing state for custom resources.
- Implementing authentication and API interactions.

You can find detailed documentation for the Terraform Provider SDK on the [official documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugin/sdk.html).

---

### **15.6. Considerations for Custom Resources**

1. **API Interactions**: Your custom provider will need to communicate with an API (or other external systems) to manage resources. Ensure that your provider is handling errors and API rate limits appropriately.

2. **State Management**: Just like any other Terraform resource, custom resources must be tracked in Terraform's state. Ensure that your provider correctly implements the `Read`, `Create`, `Update`, and `Delete` operations so that Terraform can track the state of the resource.

3. **Testing**: It’s crucial to thoroughly test your custom provider to ensure it works as expected. The Terraform Provider SDK includes utilities for testing, and you should write unit tests to validate the functionality of your provider.

4. **Compatibility**: Ensure that your custom provider remains compatible with Terraform's future versions by following the Terraform SDK's guidelines for versioning.

---

### **15.7. Conclusion**

Custom resources and custom providers are powerful tools in Terraform for managing infrastructure that isn't supported out-of-the-box. Writing a custom provider allows you to extend Terraform’s capabilities and integrate it with proprietary or legacy systems that you need to manage. While writing a custom provider is an advanced use case, it is a valuable skill for managing non-standard resources and automating complex workflows.

By using the **Terraform Provider SDK**, you can create robust and maintainable custom resources that integrate seamlessly into Terraform's ecosystem, leveraging its powerful state management and automation features.
